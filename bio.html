		<p>Hello, my name is Michele. I was born and raised in Somerville, MA and I have yet to leave; I am currently a senior at Tufts University. Despite this, I would love to travel more and therefore, I will be attending graduate school for marine biology at Hong Kong University. I often crave sushi and bubble tea. I spend my free time playing with my cat, Taiko, and online shopping.</p>
